a simple java project to do some stuff with some (very specific) csv's

## HW Requirements

- Check for duplicate ID's
- Check for invalid data
- Print data back to sys.out but formatted different

## Things I am unsure about

For my test class, I'm not sure if I should be handling exceptions there or just let them throw it to the test runner. My thoughts are, if there is an error, it's better to just fail the test and figure out what happened.
I also don't know if I did anything right.
